:On the basis of this test, at the 0.05 significance level there is not enough evidence to reject the claim that the mean weight of bumblebee bats is equal to 1.8g(p=0.0992). A 95% confidence interval is(1.7622, $\infty$ )grams. The problem was ambiguous on the randomness of the sample thus we will assume that it was not a random sample, making inference to all bumblebee bats strictly speculative.\

:   The confidence interval between fired and not fired group is (-1.5939, 5.2511) which mean the age of person who can be fired is anywhere between those interval values. Since it cannot reject the Ho, it shows there is no difference in average age between fired and not fired groups.\

:   This week permutation p-value(p=0.1592) is bigger than last week permutation p-value(0.14). Last week we did the permutation based on p value and that way is more flexible than t-test. t-test is more sensitive than p value permutation test.
