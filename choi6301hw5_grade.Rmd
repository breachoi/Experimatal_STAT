## Question 1 (total 36)

### Part A

: Compare with row data with log transformation data, the row data box plot shows the extreme outlier than log transformation data. Since we will use data for ANOVA test the log transformation data box plot looks more reasonable for the test.

```{r}
    knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/choih/OneDrive/Desktop/rowdata.jpg")
    knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/choih/OneDrive/Desktop/logTdata.jpg")
```

1.  State the Problem (5)Â 

    -   Test the claim that the mean income 2005 of those with a education level (12 years of education) is different than the others.

2.  Address the assumptions(6)\
    missing eqaul standard deviation

    -   Normality:There is strong evidence that the incomes come from normally distributed within the group after log transformation data.
    -   Independence: We will assume each groups are independent each other.

```{r 3}
     knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/choih/OneDrive/Desktop/logTdata.jpg")
```

3.  Conduct the test\

    -   Hypotheses (4)$$ H_0: \mu12 = \mu<12 = \mu13-15 = \mu16 = \mu>16 $$ $$ H_a: \mu12 \ne \mu16  $$ $$\alpha\ = 0.05$$

    -   F statistic: (2)$$ \frac{(2375-2232) /(2582-2579) }{2232/2579} $$ = 62.87

    ```{r 4}
        knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/choih/OneDrive/Desktop/hw5_1full.jpg")
        knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/choih/OneDrive/Desktop/hw5_1r.jpg")
    ```

    -   p-value (2)

    ```{r}
    ex0525 <- read.csv("C:/Users/choih/OneDrive/Desktop/ex0525.csv")

    ##Get the p-value
    pf(62.87, 4 , 2579, lower.tail=F)
    ```

4.  Decision(2)\
    Reject the Ho

5.  Write a conclusion (wrong conclusion)\
    There is strong evidence to suggest that the mean income of 12 years educated level are same from one another.(p=1.075371e-44 from on ANOVA)

6.  State the scope of inference (6)\
    This was an observational study; therefore, we cannot conclude that the extra education caused the increase in mean incomes. American who was youth at 1979 were selected from a random sample of a previously selected "National Longitudinal Survey".

### Part B (2)

-   Identify $$ R^{2} $$

```{r 5}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/choih/OneDrive/Desktop/hw5_1full.jpg")
```

### Part c (2)

-   Also specify the mean square error and how many degrees of freedom were used to estimate it: 2579

```{r }
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/choih/OneDrive/Desktop/hw5_1full.jpg")
```

### Part D

-   How strong is the evidence that at least one of the five population distributions (corresponding to the different years of education) is different from the others?(4)\
    -   There is sufficient evidence to suggest that the mean of Income of four population are different from another.(p=1.308639e-54 from an ANOVA)

```{r 1}
    ex0525 <- read.csv("C:/Users/choih/OneDrive/Desktop/ex0525.csv")

    ##Get the p-value
    pf(62.87, 4 , 2579, lower.tail=F)
```

-   How many dollars or by what percent does the mean or median for each of the last four categories exceed that of the next lowest category?(1)

    -   16(76855.46) - 16(69996.97) = 6858.49 dollars.

```{r 2}
        knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/choih/OneDrive/Desktop/Hw5_1M.jpg")
```

#Total

# Question 2 (total 22)

1.  State the Problem (1)\
    Test the claim that the mean income 2005 of those with a education level (16 years of education) is different than \>16 years of education level.

2.  Address the assumptions\

    -   Normality:There is strong evidence that the incomes come from normally distributed within the group after log transformation data.
    -   Independence: We will assume each groups are independent each other.

3.  Conduct the test\

    -   Hypotheses (4)$$ H_0: \mu16 = mu>16 $$ $$ H_a: \mu116 \ne \mu>16  $$ $$\alpha\ = 0.05$$

    -   F statistic: $$ \frac{(2245-2232) /(2581-2579) }{2232/2579} $$ = 2.311

    (10 right result but no table)

```{r}
ex0525 <- read.csv("C:/Users/choih/OneDrive/Desktop/ex0525.csv")
ex0525$Income2005 <- log(ex0525$Income2005)
boxplot(Income2005 ~ Educ, data=ex0525)

ex0525$Subject <- ifelse(ex0525$Educ %in% c('16','>16'), 
                         'a', 
                         ifelse(ex0525$Educ=='12', 'b', 
                                 ifelse(ex0525$Educ == '<12', 'c', 'd')))

summary(aov(Income2005 ~ Subject, ex0525))

##Note that you need to make Site a factor variable or R will treat it as continuous
summary(aov(Income2005 ~ as.factor(Educ), ex0525))

leveneTest(ex0525$Income2005, as.factor(ex0525$Educ))
pf(2.311, 1, 2579 ,lower.tail=F)
```

4.  Decision (2)\
    Fail to reject the Ho
5.  Write a conclusion (3 missing the confidence interval for compare)\
    There is not strong evidence to suggest that the mean income of 16 years educated level are same from \>16 years educated level.(p=0.128584 from on ANOVA)
6.  State the scope of inference ( 2 wrong casual inference)\
    This was an observational study; therefore, we cannot conclude that the extra education caused the increase in mean incomes. American who was youth at 1979 were selected from a random sample of a previously selected "National Longitudinal Survey".

# Question 3 (10)

If you could not assume that the standard deviations are the same - for the raw or log transformed data - which test do you think is most appropriate? Rather than doing a complete analysis, simply state which test you think you should use and justify the decision with appropriate plots. You may still consider the log transformed data and the regular data when deciding on a test, but you may not assume that the equal variance assumption is met in either case.\
- row data\
I think Kruskal - Wallis test is good for test for row data set. Because this data set shows non-normal distribution, ordinal data and unequal variances.\
- log transformed data\
I think Welch's ANOVA test is good enough to test for this data set. Because this data set shows unequal variances across groups, unequal sample size but each group are approximately normally distributed.
